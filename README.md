# Vaccination_UK
 
Hello everyone.

I am a Data Scientist, and this is my project which I use to learn something new and improve my skills.
All conclusions are mine. Please, be careful if you want to use these conclusions to make decisions.

Within the project, I use 

* the [Data Source](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/download),
* R and R markdown,
* Python.

The result of the project is [Main.pdf](https://github.com/mechtal/Vaccination_UK/blob/main/Main.pdf).

Contains public sector information licensed under the [Open Government Licence v3.0](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/).

## Rmd-files

[Main.Rmd](https://github.com/mechtal/Vaccination_UK/blob/main/Main.Rmd) is the main file to combine the files below.

[Datasets.Rmd](https://github.com/mechtal/Vaccination_UK/blob/main/Datasets.Rmd) is about metrics.

[DatasetSouthWest.Rmd](https://github.com/mechtal/Vaccination_UK/blob/main/DatasetSouthWest.Rmd) and [ModelSouthWest.Rmd](https://github.com/mechtal/Vaccination_UK/blob/main/ModelSouthWest.Rmd) are about the South West's dataset.

[DatasetBristol.Rmd](https://github.com/mechtal/Vaccination_UK/blob/main/DatasetBristol.Rmd) and [ModelBristol.Rmd](https://github.com/mechtal/Vaccination_UK/blob/main/ModelBristol.Rmd) are about the Bristol's dataset.

[DatasetEngland.Rmd](https://github.com/mechtal/Vaccination_UK/blob/main/DatasetEngland.Rmd) and [ModelEngland.Rmd](https://github.com/mechtal/Vaccination_UK/blob/main/ModelEngland.Rmd) are about the England's dataset.

## Functions

### R
[my_kable.R](https://github.com/mechtal/Vaccination_UK/blob/main/my_kable.R) is a function for pretty tables, [my_kable_test.Rmd](https://github.com/mechtal/Vaccination_UK/blob/main/my_kable_test.Rmd) is a test for that

[show_links.R](https://github.com/mechtal/Vaccination_UK/blob/main/show_links.R) is a function for exploring metrics, there are tests for that in the file [show_links_test.R](https://github.com/mechtal/Vaccination_UK/blob/main/show_links_test.R) 

### Python
[prepare_sets.py](https://github.com/mechtal/Vaccination_UK/blob/main/prepare_sets.py) is a function for modeling (preparing a dataset)

[train_model.py](https://github.com/mechtal/Vaccination_UK/blob/main/train_model.py) is a function for modeling (training a model)
