# Vaccination_UK
 
Hello everyone.

I am a Data Scientist, and this is my project which I use to learn something new and improve my skills.
All conclusions are mine. Please, be careful if you want to use these conclusions to make decisions.

Within the project, I use 

* the [Data Source](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/download),
* R and R markdown,
* Python.

The result of the project is [Main.pdf](https://github.com/mechtal/Vaccination_UK/blob/main/Main.pdf).
